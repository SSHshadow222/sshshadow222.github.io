        <p class="long-description">
          Taking notes is crucial when it comes to monitoring progress, as they provide 
          instant feedback on the activity's performance. Other applications use AI for 
          note-management, and some focus on fitness tracking, independently operating 
          within their specific domains. Note Tracker combines these functionalities by 
          enabling users to track any scalar value present within their notes. This 
          capability is relevant because it allows the user to not only monitor metrics 
          that are specific to certain areas or fields but also interpret these values for 
          their specific needs, such as mood metrics, health parameters, fitness goals, and 
          anything illustrable through numbers. By combining AI for note management with 
          versatile tracking features, the application improves the user experience and productivity.
