          3:Generally speaking, you wouldn't be looking for information about me if you 
          didn't already know something. What you'd expect to find here might be a summary 
          with flattering statements and some actual achievements. However, that's not the 
          case. I'll give you <span class="text-highlight">no bullshit</span>. If you want to know me better, look at my actions.
          Talk is cheap.
